Observations:

From the prelimenary aanalysis of our data we see that Region 3 contributes to most of the sales in all product sectors(Fresh', 'Milk', 'Grocery', 'Frozen','Detergents_Paper).
Specifically we see that Region 3 dominates with a whopping 73% of all consumables while Region 2 and Region 1 attribute to 10.6% and 16.32% of all sales.

We can further break down the consumables by channel, Channel 1 has a market power of 54.72% while Channel 2 has a 45.27% of recorded sales.

The following step of our analysis was to see how each prosuct is behaving in terms of it's distributions. We created a box plot of the individual product sold and we noticed that all
products had quite a bit of outliers in their sales but it we decided to work with these outliers becasue we understand that depending on the purpose of the purchase there could be a 
pool of customers that are heavy consumers due to a business. These outliers pushed the dustributions aggresively to the right, resembling a gamma distribution.

After our visual analysis we measured the measures of central tendency of each product sold, I want to focus a bit more on the 'Fresh' product since it is the one being sold at a
larger scale in comparison to all other products in all regions and channels.

The mean of this product is of 12,000 monetary units, with a standard deviation or dispersion of 12,647. You can now see how large of a right skewed distribution this is, but the
interesting fact is that all products mimic this behavior due to their high outliying points. For example, the secon most sold product are groceries, groceries has a mean of
7951 monetary units and a dispersion or standard deviation of 9503 monetary units. 

We understand how important is to know how to prepare inventory throughout a given year, and for this we decided to create sampling distributions of all products sold in order
to have a better understanding of how the averages might fluctiated within the sales period. We conducted the simulation based on the bature of the distribution of the products and 
decided to apply a Gamma fucntion distribution since it is the visualization that better represents the products population.

The results of the simulted distribution, using previous know measurmewnts of central tendency and dispresion we built cofidence intervals at a 95% confidence level. With these results
we are 95% confident that the mean of each product will fall between these intervals. With this knowledge, it is up to you if you want to maybe, under-stock or orver-stock some of these
products but before you do decide. Please allo us to conclude this anlaysis.

The following results are our confidence intervals for each product:

For Fresh: 95% confidence interval = [10795.79, 13204.8], mean = 12000.3
For Milk: 95% confidence interval = [5093.37, 6499.16], mean = 5796.27
For Grocery: 95% confidence interval = [7046.22, 8856.34], mean = 7951.28
For Frozen: 95% confidence interval = [2609.58, 3534.28], mean = 3071.93
For Detergents_Paper: 95% confidence interval = [2427.41, 3335.57], mean = 2881.49
For Delicassen: 95% confidence interval = [1256.29, 1793.45], mean = 1524.87

The marketing department requested to conduct a Hypothesis test to see if there was any dependency or correlation betweent the Region and Channels when it came to selling these products
we then conduct a Chi-square test to test for dependency of these categorical varibles and found out the Following:

P-Value: .099 a not statistically significant results at the aplha = .05
Chi-square Statistics: .009 

With these results, we failed to reject the Null Hypotheses, there is no association between channel and Region. This lead us to conclude a marketing strategy. The startegy involved 
in starting a marketing campaign to push lowe sold products with the same design to all channels and regions, without the need to adjust for specific targeted marketing.
